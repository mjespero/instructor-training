## Exercises

*   Have students write answers to the initial MCQ in the Etherpad
    or [import it into socrative][socrative-import] using this ID: SOC-25251122. Briefly summarize the answers.

*   Learners do think-pair-share for cognitive maps and multiple-choice questions.

*   In the two-day versions,
    have learners read the operations guide as their overnight homework
    and do their demotivational story just before lunch on day 2:
    it means day 2 starts with *their* questions (which wakes them up),
    and the demotivational story is a good lead-in to lunchtime discussion.

*   Don't have them complete the Teaching Perspectives Inventory
    or read through the pre- or post-assessment questionnaires in class:
    it kills momentum.

*   Have them work in pairs for the live coding exercise rather than threes,
    and don't bother recording:
    the camera can't pick up both the speaker's body language and what's on the screen.
    Afterwards, have learners put answers to the following questions in the Etherpad:
    * What felt different about live coding (vs. standing up and lecturing)? What was harder/easier?
    * Did you make any mistakes? If so, how did you handle them?
    * Did you talk and type at the same time, or alternate?
    * How often did you point at the screen? How often did you highlight with the mouse?
    * What will you try to do differently next time?

*   When teaching faded examples:
    1.  Divide trainees into groups of 4-5
    2.  Put the faded example (Python code) from the curriculum into the Etherpad.
    3.  Define the audience for these examples.
        For example, are these beginners who only know some basics programming concepts?
        Or are these learners with some experience in programming but not in Python?
        You need to provide this information so that the trainees can decide what intrinsic knowledge these audiences have.
    4.  Talk the trainees through some examples of intrinsic, germane, and extraneous knowledge
        for the Python faded example for the audiences you defined. For example:
        *   Intrinsic load: ability to read and write; understanding what variable is
        *   Germane load: learning how to loop through a collection in Python
        *   Extraneous load: need to know that Python requires indentation
    5.  Ask the trainees to discuss and identify in groups what different loads occur, and write them into the Etherpad.

    If there are people among the trainees who don't program at all,
    make sure that they are in separate groups and ask to the groups to work with that person as a learner to help identify different loads.
    Another option is to have a faded example that is not programming specific. But that may be difficult to achieve.

## Video Recorded Lessons

One of the key elements of this training course is recording trainees
and having them, and their peers, critique those recordings.
We were introduced to this practice by UBC's Warren Code,
and it has evolved to the following:

1.  On day 1, show trainees a short clip (3-4 minutes) of someone teaching a lesson
    and have them give feedback as a group.
    This feedback is organized on two axes:
    positive versus negative,
    and content versus presentation.
    The first axis is explained as "things to be repeated and emphasized" versus "things to be improved",
    while the second is explained by contrasting people who have good ideas,
    but can't communicate them (all content, no presentation)
    with people who speak well, but don't actually have anything to say.

2.  Trainees are then asked to work in groups of three.
    Each person rotates through the roles of instructor, audience, and videographer.
    As the instructor,
    they have two minutes to explain one key idea from their research (or other work)
    as if they were talking to a class of interested high school students.
    The person pretending to be the audience is there to be attentive,
    while the videographer records the session using a cellphone or similar device.

3.  After everyone has taught,
    the trio sits together and watches all three videos in succession,
    writing out feedback on the same 2x2 grid introduced above.
    Once all the videos have been reviewed,
    the group rejoins the class;
    each person puts all the feedback on themselves into the Etherpad.

In order for this exercise to work well:

*   Groups must be physically separated to reduce audio cross-talk between their recordings.
    In practice,
    this means 2-3 groups in a normal-sized classroom,
    with the rest using nearby breakout spaces,
    coffee lounges,
    offices,
    or (on one occasion) a janitor's storage closet.

*   Do all three recordings before reviewing any of them,
    because otherwise the person to go last is short-changed on time.

*   People must give feedback on themselves,
    as well as giving feedback on each other,
    so that they can calibrate their impressions of their own teaching
    according to the impressions of other people.
    (We find that most people are harder on themselves than others are,
    and it's important for them to realize this.)

*   At the end of day 1,
    ask trainees to review the lesson episode
    you will use for the live coding demonstration at the start of day 2.

*   Try to make at least one mistake during the demonstration of live coding
    so that trainees can see you talk through diagnosis and recovery,
    and draw attention afterward to the fact that you did this.

The announcement of this exercise is often greeted with groans and apprehension,
since few people enjoy seeing or hearing themselves.
However,
it is consistently rated as one of the most valuable parts of the class,
and also serves as an ice breaker:
we want pairs of instructors at actual workshops to give one another feedback,
and that's much easier to do once they've had some practice
and have a rubric to follow.

## Live Coding Demo Videos

Note on closed captioning: Sometimes audio in the room can be poor. Two suggestions for improving accessibility are to have students watch it on their own laptops and to turn on closed captioning by pressing the `cc` button at the bottom of the video.

**[Part 1][live-coding-bad]: how not to do it**

*   Instructor ignores a red sticky clearly visible on a learner's laptop.
*   Instructor is sitting, mostly looking at the laptop screen.
*   Instructor is typing commands without saying them out loud.
*   Instructor uses fancy bash prompt.
*   Instructor uses small font in not full-screen terminal window with black background.
*   The terminal window bottom is partially blocked by the learner's heads for those sitting in the back.
*   Instructor receives a a pop-up notification in the middle of the session.
*   Instructor makes a mistake (a typo) but simply fixes it without pointing it out, and redoes the command.

**[Part 2][live-coding-good]: how to do it right**

*   Instructor checks if the learner with the red sticky on her laptop still needs attention.
*   Instructor is standing while instructing, making eye-contact with participants.
*   Instructor is saying the commands out loud while typing them.
*   Instructor moves to the screen to point out details of commands or results.
*   Instructor simply uses ‘$ ‘ as bash prompt.
*   Instructor uses big font in wide-screen terminal window with white background.
*   The terminal window bottom is above the learner's heads for those sitting in the back.
*   Instructor makes mistake (a typo) and uses the occasion to illustrate how to interpret error-messages.

## Motivation and Demotivation

*   In the exercise on brainstorming motivational challenges,
    review the comments in the Etherpad.
    Rather than read all out loud, highlight the common themes
    (i.e. establish value, positive expectations, promote self efficiency)
    or things that stand out our that you can relate to.
    Note: this exercise can be done before or going through the above list.

*   In the exercise on brainstorming demotivational experiences,
    review the comments in the Etherpad.
    Rather than read all out loud,
    highlight a few of the things that could have been done differently.
    This will give everyone some confidence in how to handle these situations in the future.
